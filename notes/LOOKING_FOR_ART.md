Lists of potential art assets to use on the site.

- https://iconscout.com/3d/web-development-5402863 - I think this is honestly PERFECT, maybe after some tweaks to the color. However, this is exclusive to a website that requires an annual subscription to download it, :(
- https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/windows-programming-code-3d-icon_16802495.htm - Also looks really good, try to see if the artist has his stuff on a service which is more affordable
- https://isometric.online/ - Great 3D icons, ALL FREE
